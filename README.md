# BBS Academic Core
Pre-Foundation Academic Preparation Repository

## Status
This repository operates in a **pre-foundation, pre-agreement academic preparation mode**.

No legal entity (foundation, association, or institution) has been formally established at this stage.
No institutional agreements with universities or research organizations are currently in place.

The materials published here do **not** create legal, financial, institutional, or contractual obligations for any party.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to serve as a **central academic preparation core** for future multi-university research collaboration around the BBS (Big Begins Small) system concept.

This repository is designed to:
- define ethical and structural boundaries,
- describe a controlled research sandbox model,
- establish transparent academic collaboration principles,
- prepare the ground for future institutional cooperation once formal structures are established.

This is **not** a production system.
This is **not** an operational platform.
This is **not** a deployment environment.

## Scope
The Academic Core defines:
- conceptual architecture for research and testing,
- ethical principles governing all future modules,
- governance logic for academic participation,
- boundaries between research, experimentation, and production systems.

The Academic Core does **not** include:
- any production code,
- any operational decision engines,
- any real-world data,
- any security keys or credentials,
- any governmental or political implementations.

## Relation to Other Public Resources
This repository exists alongside, but is distinct from:
- Vision and narrative platforms (e.g. conceptual or philosophical resources),
- Reference or showcase repositories illustrating system structure.

This Academic Core is the **only canonical entry point for future academic research collaboration**.

## Intended Audience
This repository is intended for:
- universities and academic departments,
- researchers and doctoral candidates,
- institutional partners evaluating future collaboration,
- foundations and grant evaluators reviewing preparatory infrastructure.

It is **not** intended for direct public deployment or end-user interaction.

## Participation
At this stage:
- the repository is publicly readable,
- contributions are not yet accepted,
- no formal participation process is active.

Contribution rules and academic participation frameworks will be defined in subsequent phases.

## Transparency Statement
All preparatory materials are published openly to ensure:
- clarity of intent,
- transparency of boundaries,
- ethical responsibility toward future partners.

No claims of institutional endorsement are made or implied.

## Academic Preparation Structure
The academic preparation initiative is structured in three layers:

1. Academic Core
   Defines principles, boundaries, governance, and preparation logic.

2. University Workspace Template
   Provides a standardized structure for per-university research environments.

3. Pre-Activation Workspaces
   Prepared, inactive repositories that can be activated upon formal academic agreement.

This structure allows parallel preparation with multiple institutions while preserving clarity, responsibility, and institutional integrity.
