# Governance Framework
Academic Preparation Phase

## Purpose of Governance
This document defines the governance principles for the BBS Academic Core during the pre-foundation phase.

Its purpose is to ensure:
- clarity of responsibility,
- protection against fragmentation,
- ethical and structural consistency,
- controlled evolution of the academic preparation process.

## Decision Authority
During the pre-foundation phase:
- strategic decisions are coordinated by the project initiators,
- no external party holds decision-making authority,
- no voting or representative governance mechanisms are active.

This structure will be revised once a formal institutional entity is established.

## Repository Control
The BBS Academic Core repository:
- is read-only for the public,
- does not accept external code contributions at this stage,
- serves as a canonical reference for future academic collaboration.

All changes are curated to preserve coherence and integrity.

## Academic Participation Model
Academic participation is prepared, but not yet activated.

Future participation will be structured through:
- dedicated per-university repositories,
- clearly defined scopes of responsibility,
- time-bound research phases,
- explicit attribution and authorship rules.

No academic institution participates implicitly or automatically.

## Separation of Concerns
The following separation is strictly maintained:
- Academic Core: principles, boundaries, preparation.
- University Workspaces: experiments, research, testing.
- Production Systems: excluded entirely from this phase.

No experimental work directly modifies the Academic Core.

## Transparency and Integrity
All governance principles are published openly to:
- avoid hidden control structures,
- prevent misinterpretation of authority,
- ensure ethical responsibility toward future partners.

Governance mechanisms will evolve only through explicit, documented updates.
